<h4>Ascension (Re-Sound Design)</h4>		  
<p>It was fun working on all the aspects of Sound Design, SFX, V.O. and music composition of this project. When you start working on the Foley of a film, you realize that for example SFX for foot steps on the snow do not necessarily have to be recorded on the snow and certainly not with your feet. You would be surprised how sometimes the least imagined material works just fine for what you need. Ascension is a short animated film created by Thomas B. at Supinfocom studios. France. The re-sound design of this video is used only for educational purposes and only aims to inspire and support the original sound design and music content.</p><br><br>

<h4>The Pantheon (Re-Sound Design)</h4>
<p>All the original audio from this film was removed and then we recorded our own from scratch in the studio for the sound design class BECA530 at San Francisco State University, in 2023.
My contribution to the project was composing and mixing the music, recording, editing & mixing. For the music score, I wanted something epic but also as at the beginning of the movie the scenes were more suspense-like, I felt there had to be more protagonism in the sound design and foley work. This strategy helped to create the necessary tension that would prepare the viewer for the final scene, The battle. For this personal mix version, I added extra components such as foley layers, a male voice, and the master of the final mix. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Short footage taken from Mad Max II (The Road Warrior) released in 1982. Directed by George Miller. Warner Bros Entertainment Inc. The Sound Design and Music for this clip was created by Anka Tosun & Nicolas Fernandez for the Audio for Visual Media course at the College of San Mateo.

<h4>Check Mate (Re-Sound Design)</h4>
<p>When I saw this story it really impacted me.  It was the perfect opportunity to explore a more obscure theme where the music could drive the different sensations the protagonist was going through due to the guilt she was carrying. I will not give you more spoilers though, so you can watch it yourself. This re-sound design of TSUME was made in collaboration with Anmichaelle Yabut in the Electronic Music program at the College of San Mateo. Check Mate is an adaptation from the original short animated film called TSUME from Supinfocom by David Broner, Kevin Cordier-Royer, Tristan Jaegly, Vincent Touache, Chien-Chang Wu, Jake Delamare. This adaptation is used only for educational purposes and only aims to inspire and support the original sound design and music content.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
